# finalProject
This project was created by Paige O'Neil, Kaleigh West, Hewan Kasie, and Naina Sharma.


The data used for the project can be found for download from the following links: 

Mental Health CSV: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health?select=1-+mental-illnesses-prevalence.csv

Causes of Death CSV: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/cause-of-deaths-around-the-world

NOTE: For the Google Cloud section, the code requires a JSON key file. The code has been commented out to prevent an error from being thrown. This file will not be provided in the github for confidentiality, but if needed we can provide it.
